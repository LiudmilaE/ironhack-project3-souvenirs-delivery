# Ironhack | Project 3 | SPA Souvenirs Delivery

## Introduction

This is a repository for an individual final project for Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp in two week timeframe.
My project idea was to create a platform to share empty baggage space. 
And the result is a MEVN(MongoDB-Express-Vue-Node) full stack application, hosted on Heroku.

## Used technologies
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- ExpressJS
- VueJS
- Buefy
- Webpack
- Axios
- REST API
- Kanban / [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/xzOZRTlw/ironhack-project-3-souvenir-delivery)

## Personal Opinion
It was a really big challenge to create in two weeks SPA. 
I really enjoyed to work with Vue.js framework.
I think that I created an interesting and decent application, which was included in the top five final projects of our cohort.
Of course there is a lot to improve, but overall I'm happy with the result.
